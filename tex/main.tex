\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\todo{This is more like a `background to forecast reconciliation' section rather than an intro.  We will write an intro at the end}
Data in business analytics and economics often occurs naturally in additive hierarchical structures. Swiss exports for instance can be disaggregated by destination into geographical groups such as Europe, North America or Australia. Each region in turn can then be further disaggregated by country. In some cases of hierarchical data structures, the series at the bottom of a hierarchy can be added up in more than one unique way to the main aggregate. This is referred to as a grouped time series by \cite{Hyndman2016}. Swiss exports for instance can also be disaggregated into product categories such as precision instruments, textiles or metals. Each category in turn is the sum of further subcategories. Figure \ref{fig:tree} gives an example of a simple grouped hierarchy with $k = 3$ levels, $m = 9$ series in total and $q = 4$ series at the bottom.

\end{figure}
All hierarchies are subject to strict aggregation constraints. In order to express the constraints in this example hierarchy, $Y_t$ is defined to be a vector containing the top-down stacked observations from all levels. $Y_{k,t}$ contains the observations at the bottom level $k$ of the hierarchy and $S$ is a corresponding aggregation matrix.
\begin{align*}
\underset{(m\times 1)}{Y_t} = \begin{bmatrix}
\ Y_0\ \ \\
\ Y_A\ \ \\
\ Y_B\ \ \\
\ Y_1\ \ \\
\ Y_2\ \ \\
\ Y_{A1}\ \ \\
\ Y_{A2}\ \ \\
\ Y_{B1}\ \ \\
\ Y_{B2}\ \ 
\end{bmatrix} \quad \underset{(m\times q)}{S} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \ \ \\
\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \ \ \\
\ 0 & 0  & 1 & 1\ \ \\
\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \ \ \\
\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\ \ \\
\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \ \ \\
\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \ \ \\
\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \ \ \\
\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\ \ 
\end{bmatrix} \quad \underset{(q\times 1)}{Y_{k,t}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	\ Y_{A1}\ \ \\
	\ Y_{A2}\ \ \\
	\ Y_{B1}\ \ \\
	\ Y_{B2}\ \ 
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align*}
For realized data, it must hold at each point in time that $Y_t = S Y_{k,t}$. Forecasts of the individual series however usually do not fulfill these aggregation constraints. Incoherences may arise due to model bias, varying information sets or different models used when predicting the individual series in a hierarchy. Following \cite{Gross1990}, a simple way to ensure consistency is the «bottom-up» approach. This means that only the bottom level series are forecasted and then summed up according to the hierarchical structure. It implies that forecasts from higher levels are not taken into account, even though they are usually better to predict than the noisier series at the bottom of a hierarchy. Another possibility is the «top-down» approach described in \cite{Athanasopoulos2009}, where the forecast of the top level series is disaggregated according to the historical or forecasted proportions at lower levels. This approach does not take into account the time series characteristics at lower levels. A compromise is given by the «middle-out» approach, where the forecasts at an intermediate level of the hierarchy are summed up to get the higher levels and disaggregated to obtain lower level predictions.

Many empirical studies have shown that forecast combinations improve accuracy because of information pooling and the averaging over misspecification biases and measurement errors.\footnote{See for instance \cite{Timmermann2006} or \cite{Watson2004} for a comprehensive overview.} Similarly, it is beneficial to combine information from all forecasts in a hierarchy. \cite{Hyndman2011} have shown that optimal, reconciled predictions can be obtained using the following regression approach.
\begin{align}
Y_t(h) &= S\beta_{h} + e_t(h)
\end{align}
where $Y_t(h)$ is an ($m \times 1$) vector containing the h-periods-ahead forecasts at time $t$ for each level in the hierarchy. $\beta_{h}$ represents the optimal predictions at the bottom level that minimize the deviations between the base forecasts and the consistent hierarchy. The error term $e_t(h)$ follows a normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma_h$. There is obviously a high level of heteroskedasticity in the error terms, which is why the simple ordinary least squares regression approach often leads to poor results. In order to account for this, $\beta_h$ can be estimated from a weighted least squares regression.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:reg}
\beta_{h} &= \left(S'W_h^{-1}S \right)^{-1} S'W_h^{-1}Y_t(h)
\end{align}
Intuitively, $\beta_h$ minimizes the reconciliation bias, which is the distance between actual and reconciled forecasts across the entire hierarchy. \cite{Hyndman2016} use the covariance matrix $\Sigma_h$ of the $h$-step-ahead base forecast errors as the weighting matrix $W_h$. This «GLS» approach decreases the weight of forecasts with a high prediction error in the regression. In the «MinT» approach, \cite{Wickramasuriya2015} use the covariance matrix of the $h$-step-ahead reconciled forecast errors, which they show results in the best linear unbiased reconciled forecasts. Lastly, the «nseries» approach, proposed by \cite{Athanasopoulos2017}, uses weights based on the number of series aggregated at each node.\\

This paper contributes to the literature on optimal hierarchical forecasting by constructing a Bayesian reconciliation framework that generalizes previous approaches. In section \ref{sec:model}, it introduces an explicit definition of the coherency errors as model parameters. Probabilistic reconciliation takes the uncertainty surrounding these parameters into account and leads to reconciled density forecasts. Furthermore, flexible shrinkage priors enable the model to shrink selected reconciled forecasts towards their base forecast. In section \ref{sec:appl}, the method is compared with existing reconciliation techniques using a comprehensive hierarchical dataset of Swiss goods exports.

\section{Bayesian Forecast Reconciliation}
\label{sec:model}
\subsection{Model}
Density forecasts have the benefit of providing additional information about the uncertainty surrounding a measure of central tendency. Recent years have seen an increase in the use of model combinations for density forecasts, such as \cite{Kapetanios2015} and \cite{Cesur2016}. In their spirit, the predictive densities of the $m$ base forecast models are approximated by drawing samples of size $n$ from the respective distributions. There are $n$ vectors $\hat{y}_{i}$ each of length $m$ that contain a draw $i$ from each predictive distribution.\footnote{Since every forecast horizon is reconciled independently, the time subscripts are dropped from now on to simplify notation.} The error term consists of two components, a prediction error $e_{i}$ and a reconciliation bias $\alpha$. The latter can be interpreted as a fixed effect that is unique to each forecasted variable. In other terms, $\alpha$ is the difference between the unreconciled forecast mean $\hat{y}$ and the reconciled forecast mean $\tilde{y}$. The interpretation of $\beta$ depends on the definition of $S$, but in general it estimates the mean of the bottom level reconciled forecasts. The following equation can then be used to model the forecast reconciliation.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:main}
\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
	$\hat{y}_i$ & $=$ & $\alpha$ & + &$S$ & $\times$ & $\beta$ & $+$ & $e_i$ \\
	$\scriptscriptstyle (m\times 1)$ & & $\scriptscriptstyle (m\times 1)$  & & $ \scriptscriptstyle (m\times q) $ & & $\scriptscriptstyle (q\times 1)$ & & $\scriptscriptstyle (m\times 1)$
\end{tabular}
\end{align}
where $e$ follows a normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix $\Sigma$. While $\Sigma$ is not singular by definition because the forecasts in $\hat{y}_{i}$ are not reconciled, it might be near-singular if the base forecasting models are estimated jointly. In the much more common case of independently estimated univariate models, $\Sigma$ is simply a diagonal matrix. The regression equation can equivalently be written as
\begin{align}
	\hat{y}_i &=  S\beta + v_i, \quad v_i \sim (\alpha,\Sigma)
\end{align}
This clarifies that a draw from the predictive distribution of any base forecast deviates from the coherent subspace either due to a idiosyncratic prediction error or due to the reconciliation bias that is common to all draws from this particular prediction. The unreconciled forecasts $\hat{y}_{i}$ follow a multivariate normal distribution.
\begin{align}
\hat{y}\ |\ \alpha,\beta,\Sigma \sim N(\alpha + S\beta,\Sigma)
\end{align}
We are however interested in the reconciled forecasts $\tilde{y} \sim N(S\beta,\Sigma)$, which can be obtained by conditioning on $\alpha = 0$. An estimate for the reconciled means is therefore given by the conditional mean and variance functions.
\begin{align*}
E(\tilde{y}) &= E(\hat{y}|\alpha = 0,\beta,\Sigma) = \int \hat{y} f_{\hat{y}|\alpha,\beta,\Sigma}(0,\beta,\Sigma)\ d\hat{y} \\
Var(\tilde{y}) &= Var(\hat{y}|\alpha = 0,\beta,\Sigma) =  \int (\hat{y} - E(\tilde{y}))^2 f_{\hat{y}|\alpha,\beta,\Sigma}(0,\beta,\Sigma)\ d\hat{y}
\end{align*}
The reconciled conditional distribution and the corresponding moments can be retrieved conveniently from the Gibbs sampling algorithm described in the following subsection.\\

\subsection{Estimation}
To account for cross-equation correlations, the reconciliation problem in (\ref{eq:main}) can be expressed as a system of seemingly unrelated regressions. Since the explanatory variables are the same for each equation, it is a special case of the SUR model in \cite{Zellner1962}. However, the parameters are impossible to estimate directly because of perfect multicollinearity in the regressors $I_m$ and $S$. As a result, there is no unique solution available and equation \ref{eq:main} represents an ill-posed problem. A convenient answer to this identification issue is given by Bayesian regularization methods. Following \cite{Farebrother1978}, the regression is partitioned in order to separate the parameters that cause multicollinearity. By imposing a small degree of prior shrinkage on the reconciliation biases $\alpha$, it will be possible to find a unique solution to the entire estimation problem.\\

In Bayesian statistics, data is considered to be fixed and parameters are treated as random variables. The researcher has a prior belief about the distribution of the parameters in a model. After observing the data, this prior belief is combined with the likelihood according to Bayes' theorem in order to obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters. This principle can be applied to $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\Sigma$ in the reconciliation regression.
\begin{align}
	f(\alpha, \beta, \Sigma\ |\ \hat{y}) \propto f(\hat{y}\ |\ \alpha, \beta, \Sigma) \times f(\alpha, \beta, \Sigma)
\end{align}
In other words, the posterior distribution of the bottom-level forecasts is proportional to the likelihood of the hierarchy to be consistent times the prior distribution of the parameters. Because the priors are chosen as uninformative as possible, preferences about the importance of certain base forecasts are accommodated in the likelihood function. Defining $\Lambda$ as a diagonal weighting matrix, the minimization problem is given by the weighted mean squared error.
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \Big( \Lambda(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S\beta)\Big)^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \Big( \Lambda e_i\Big)^2
\end{align}
The likelihood function for the data is then given by 
\begin{align*}
f(\hat{y}\ &|\ \alpha,\beta,\Sigma) \propto \frac{1}{|\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'|} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \sum_i \big( \Lambda(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S\beta)\big)'\big(\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'\big)^{-1}\big(\Lambda(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S\beta)\big)\right]
\end{align*}
Possible designs for the hyperparameter $\Lambda$ are discussed in subsection \ref{sec:weighting}, but it is crucial to note that its definition affects the covariance matrix of the distribution, but not the mean. This special case arises because the reconciliation equation provides a perfect fit for the prediction mean. The posterior distribution is accordingly
\begin{align*}
f(\alpha,\beta,\Sigma\ |\ \hat{y}) & \propto \frac{1}{|\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'|} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \sum_i \big( \Lambda(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S\beta)\big)'\big(\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'\big)^{-1}\big(\Lambda(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S\beta)\big)\right] \\
&\times \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - a_0)'A_0^{-1}(\alpha - a_0)\right] \\
&\times \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}(\beta - b_0)'B_0^{-1}(\beta - b_0)\right] \\
&\times \frac{1}{|\Sigma|(v_0 - m - 1)} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2} tr(R_0^{-1}\Sigma^{-1}) \right]
\end{align*}
The Bayesian approach has the advantage that uncertainty surrounding the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\Sigma$ is taken into account when calculating the conditional expectation of $\tilde{y}$. In order to approximate the distribution of $\hat{y}$, we draw $n$ $h$-periods-ahead-predictions $\hat{y}_i$ from their unreconciled predictive distributions. Following \cite{Percy1992}, we get the marginal distributions by approximating the joint posterior distribution via Gibbs sampling from the conditional distributions.  This is usually achieved very quickly, irrespective of the starting values. It can be verified by testing for stability in the recursive means of the Markov chains. After convergence is achieved, a sufficiently large sample of draws from the joint posterior is saved and evaluated. After choosing a set of arbitrary starting values, the following steps are repeated until convergence.\\


\noindent\textbf{Step 1: Draw $\beta$ conditional on $\alpha,\Sigma,\hat{y},S$}\\
The parameter $\beta$ is the mean of the bottom level forecasts, given an appropriate aggregation matrix $S$. The weighting matrix $\Lambda$ cancels out nicely when calculating the conditional posterior distribution.
\begin{align}
\beta\ |\ \alpha,\Sigma,\hat{y} &\sim N(b_1,B_1)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
B_1 &= \left(\sum_i S'\Sigma^{-1}S + B_0^{-1}\right)^{-1} \\
b_1 &= B_1 \left(\sum_i S'\Sigma^{-1} (\hat{y}_i - \alpha) + B_0^{-1}b_0\right)
\end{align*}
Unless there is reason to believe otherwise, the priors $b_0$ and $B_0$ should be chosen as uninformative as possible. In some cases, negative values in the reconciled forecasts are a concern. This issue can be resolved quite uncomplicated during the sampling process by discarding draws of $\beta$ that contain negative entries.\\

\noindent\textbf{Step 2: Draw $\Sigma$ conditional on $\alpha,\beta,\hat{y},S$}\\
$\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of the prediction errors. Depending on how the draws from each predictive distribution are ordered in $Y$, there is more or less structure in the off-diagonal elements. $\Sigma$ can be drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution.
\begin{align}
\Sigma\ |\ \alpha,\beta,\hat{y} \sim W^{-1}(v_1,R_1)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
v_1 &= v_0 + n\\
R_1 &=  \left( R_0^{-1} + \sum_i (\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S \beta)'(\hat{y}_i - \alpha - S \beta) \right)^{-1}
\end{align*}
It is useful to set an almost uninformative prior with $v_0$ and $R_0$ very close to zero, which introduces a tiny bit of noise into the reconciled forecasts. This has negligible impact on the posterior distribution, but ensures that $\Sigma$ is nonsingular in the case where a base forecast has no variation. If there is no correlation between the base forecast distributions, for instance if they originate from independent univariate models, it might be faster for large hierarchies to draw the variances equation-by-equation from an inverse gamma distribution.\\

\noindent\textbf{Step 3: Draw $\alpha$ conditional on $\beta,\Sigma,\hat{y},S$}\\
It is necessary to impose an informative prior on the reconciliation bias $\alpha$ in order to achieve identification. This process of adding information to solve an ill-posed problem is referred to as regularization\footnote{Parameter shrinkage  has been studied extensively in the literature on regularization techniques for high-dimensional data, where penalties lead to the selection of models with fewer predictors and less variance. See for instance \cite{Polson2010} for an overview.}. The conditional distribution of $\alpha$  can be obtained by concentrating out $\beta$ in the partitioned regression model. Equation (\ref{eq:prior1}) shows the basic reconciliation identity.
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:prior1}
	a &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat{y}_i - Sb
\end{align}
In order to eliminate $b$ from equation (\ref{eq:prior1}), both sides of the equation are multiplied by the projection matrix $P = S(S'\big(\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'\big)^{-1}S)^{-1}S'\big(\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'\big)^{-1}$. The resulting term is then subtracted from equation (\ref{eq:prior1}), which concentrates out $b$.
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:prior2}
	(I_m - P)\ a &= (I_m - P)\ \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat{y}_i  
\end{align}
It is useful to define the idempotent residual maker $M = I_m - P$. Using an identity matrix for $W$, the residual maker generates the generalized least squares residuals that result from a regression of the reconciliation biases on the aggregation matrix $S$. Because the generated residuals are by definition the reconciliation biases, it follows that $Ma = a$.

This simplification leaves the reconciliation biases as a function of the data and the residual maker $M$. This result is again very intuitive since the reconciliation biases are the residuals from a regression of the base forecasts on the aggregation matrix.
\begin{align}
a &= M\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat{y}_i\right)
\end{align}
Due to the presence of multicollinearity, an inverse of the covariance matrix $M\Sigma M'/n$ does not exist. This issue can be resolved by introducing a tiny amount of uncertainty $A_0$  to the diagonal entries. This leads to a negligible bias, but significantly less variation in the parameter estimates. This is referred to as a ridge estimator, developed by \cite{Brown1980} and extended to the seemingly unrelated regression framework by \cite{Haitovsky1987} and \cite{Firinguetti1997}. Having enforced the orthogonality of reconciliation biases and summation matrix $S$, the prior variance $A_0$ is allowed to be uninformative. The prior mean $a_0$ is a zero vector. A numerically stable conditional posterior for $\alpha$ is therefore given by
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:alpha}
	\alpha\ |\ \beta,\Sigma,\hat{y} &\sim N(a_1,A_1)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align*}
	A_1 &= M\Bigg(\frac{\Sigma}{n}\Bigg)M' + A_0\\
	a_1 &= M\Bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat{y}_i\Bigg) + A_0^{-1}a_0
\end{align*}
The precision of this approach can be verified easily by comparing the estimate of $\alpha$ and the reconciliation biases from the fitted values. \\


\subsection{Weighting}
\label{sec:weighting}
Using an identity matrix for the weighting matrix $W$ reduces the equations to generalized least squares regressions. Even though it is intuitive to weigh the reconciliation biases based on the predictive accuracy of the corresponding base forecasts, this can be generalized to different weighting schemes. There may exist prior information on the reliability of certain models or the requirement to fix some forecasts at specific values. This could be due to better data availability, higher suitability of a particular model or subjective judgment of the forecaster.

In these cases, it might be of interest to selectively shrink some reconciliation biases in $\alpha$ towards zero by increasing their weight in $W$. At the same time, it is necessary to decrease the weight of the remaining elements such that they are able to capture the potentially increased reconciliation biases at their level of the hierarchy. This is achieved by keeping constant the total dispersion of the  multivariate normal distribution $\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'$. A common measure is the generalized variance described in \cite{Mustonen1997} and defined as the determinant of a covariance matrix. The weighting matrix $W = (\Lambda\Lambda')^{-1}$ is therefore constructed such that the product of the diagonal elements remains constant at 1. This in turn ensures that the total dispersion of $\Lambda\Sigma\Lambda'$ remains equal to the total dispersion of the unweighted $\Sigma$ for all $\Lambda$.\\

Besides the shrinkage of selected reconciliation biases towards zero, there are several other weighting methods conceivable.  Possible approaches include the weighting of each series by its level in the hierarchy or by to the number of series at each node in the hierarchy. This allows for the emulation of the «nseries», «bottom-up», «middle-out» and «top-down» results. Various examples of how to shrink reconciliation biases are given in appendix \ref{subsec:scaling}. A convenient feature of this is that the «middle-out» and «top-down» shrinkage work also for grouped time series, which is not the case in the standard approach.\\

\todo{Maybe this could be a good moment to talk briefly about the geometric interpretations of different weighting schemes? Is your book chapter a good reference for this?}

\section{Empirical Application}
\label{sec:appl}
\subsection{Data}
We use a comprehensive dataset of exports and imports of goods in Switzerland, provided by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration. It contains the nominal value in Swiss francs of goods traded with 8 geographical regions, aggregated from 245 countries and dependent territories. In addition, the goods can be classified into economic sectors, following a national nomenclature covering 12 main groups and 48 subgroups\footnote{Precious metals, precious and semi-precious stones, works of art and antiques are generally omitted in business cycle research due to volatility and structural breaks.}. This leads to a grouped hierarchy with 13'084 time series containing nonzero entries in total. The data covers a period from 1988 to 2018 in monthly frequency and is not adjusted for seasonalities or working days. Figure \ref{fig:area} shows the composition of the regional and categorical hierarchies and their historical developments.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/fig_area}
	\caption{Regional and Categorical Contribution to Swiss Exports of Goods}\label{fig:area}
	\footnotesize{Nominal values, not seasonally adjusted. Time series range from 1988 to 2018 in monthly frequency. Average export shares of the year 2018 in parentheses.}
\end{figure}
As a result of its status as a small open economy in a rapidly globalizing world, Swiss exports have increased significantly since the late 1980s. Accounting for more than half of total exports, Europe is a key market for Swiss goods. Increasingly larger shares of exports also go to North America and East Asia with around 17\% each. Exports to Africa and the Middle East, Latin America, Central and South Asia and Australia account only for a bit more than 10\% combined.

The hierarchical grouping by categories is more evenly distributed. The most important categories are «chemicals and pharmaceuticals», «precision instruments» and «machines and electronics». Figure \ref{fig:treemap} shows the changes in composition between 1988 and 2018.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/fig_treemap}
	\caption{Swiss Exports in Goods}\label{fig:treemap}
\end{figure}
The two hierarchical groupings are quite different. The geographic hierarchy with 8 groups and 245 subgroups is very wide.  With a majority of the export volume going to European countries, it is nevertheless highly concentrated. In the past 30 years, the relative share of exports to the rest of the world, but especially to North America and East Asia, has increased substantially. The categorical hierarchy on the other hand is rather narrow with 12 groups and 48 subgroups. Compared to the regional hierarchy, the export volume is however more evenly distributed, even though an increasing concentration can be noted.\\

Time series at the bottom of a hierarchy are usually harder to predict than the ones at the top. Due to the aggregation involved, top level series have less observational noise and exhibit more predictable characteristics such as seasonality or trend. Following \cite{Kang2017}, it is possible to construct a measure of predictability for each time series. They estimate principal components from a number of time series features that are commonly associated with better predictability. This includes measures such as the strength of seasonality, trend, spectral entropy and serial correlation. Figure \ref{fig:feature} shows the first principal component, which accounts for a large share of the variation in these predictability features.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/fig_confetti}
	\caption{Predictability of Different Levels in a Hierarchy} \label{fig:feature}
\end{figure}
It is evident that there exists a strong correlation between predictability and export volume. This implies that larger series and consequently the series at the top of a hierarchy will be easier to forecast. This finding strengthens the claim that reconciliation biases for top level series should be relatively smaller than those at the bottom level.\\


\subsection{Setup}
The Bayesian framework and various competing methods are tested using forecasts of each month from 1998 to 2018. The expanding training sample starts in 1988 and stops at the end of the year preceding the forecasted month. Various accuracy measures such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute scaled error (MASE) are then calculated over all months of the year following the training sample. For instance, the mean squared error for the year 2000 is calculated by averaging over the forecasts for all months in the year 2000, using data until December 1999. Gaps between the training and testing samples of one and two years are tested as well in order to check the robustness of the results with different forecasting horizons.\\

For each of the 13'084 series, forecasts are calculated from three models: An autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) and a seasonal random walk model (RW). As described in \cite{Hyndman2008}, the model for each series is parametrized automatically based on the Akaike information criterion. In order to get samples from the predictive densities, $n = 1000$ sample paths are simulated from each fitted model. With the exception of the volatile period during the Great Recession, the ARIMA and ETS approaches outperform the Random Walk consistently for series at every level and forecasting horizon. All results in the following subsection will therefore rely on ARIMA forecasts using an expanding training sample until the preceding year.\footnote{A comparison of forecasting methods, horizons and accuracy measures can be found in appendix \ref{sec:robust}.}\\

The forecasts are then reconciled using several basic and optimal reconciliation methods. The basic techniques include bottom-up, top-down and middle-out reconciliation. The latter two can only be used for non-grouped time series and are therefore tested on the regional and categorical hierarchies separately. The optimal combination methods tested are the ordinary and weighted least squares, nseries, MinT and Bayesian reconciliation approaches. If aggregation of the reconciliation errors is necessary, they are weighted with their respective export share.\\


\clearpage

\subsection{Results}
This section will explore empirical evidence for the benefits of optimal hierarchical combination. Figure \ref{fig:mase} shows the mean absolute scaled errors of basic and optimal reconciliation methods. The MASE has the advantage that the errors are scaled the same at all levels. The forecast errors tend to be higher at the lowest levels of the hierarchy and in particular for the country level series, which are more fragmented. It is also evident that the basic reconciliation method are often not able to beat the unreconciled forecasts, indicated by the horizontal lines. The bottom-up reconciliation appears to aggregate a lot of model bias from the lowest levels, whereas the middle-out and top-down approaches fare reasonably well at least for higher levels. It is also worth noting that optimal combination methods and bottom-up forecasts are the only techniques that allows for a consistency across all levels of a grouped hierarchy.

 	\caption[Forecast Errors of Reconciliation Methods]{\textbf{Forecast Errors of Reconciliation Methods.} Lower bars indicate more accurate forecasts. Horizontal lines show the mean absolute scaled error of unreconciled forecasts.}\label{fig:mase}
 \end{figure}
Optimal combination forecasts on the other hand tend to outperform the basic methods. Their benefits are even more pronounced in figure \ref{fig:rmse}. It shows the accuracy of forecasts, defined as the RMSE of the unreconciled forecasts relative to the RMSE of the reconciliation method. The root mean squared error is arguably a better measure for accuracy since it represents the criterion to be minimized in the loss function of the underlying base forecast models. While the basic reconciliation methods rarely outperform the accuracy of the unreconciled forecasts, the optimal combination techniques improve the accuracy significantly at almost all levels. Especially the WLS, MinT and BSR estimator work very well, whereas the nseries and OLS approaches lead to very volatile results for bottom level series with a low volume.

	\caption[Accuracy of Reconciliation Methods]{\textbf{Accuracy of Reconciliation Methods.} Higher bars indicate better forecasts. Zero line shows the accuracy of unreconciled predictions.} \label{fig:rmse}
\end{figure}
Having established that some optimal combination methods lead to consistently better results, it is instructive to look at the development of their forecasting accuracy over time.
