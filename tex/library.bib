abstract = {Many empirical studies have used numerical Bayesian methods for structural inference in vector autoregressions that are identified solely on the basis of sign restrictions. Because sign restrictions only provide set-identification of structural parameters, over certain regions of the parameter space the posterior inference could only be a restatement of prior beliefs. In this paper we characterize these regions, explicate the beliefs about parameters that are implicit in conventional priors, provide an analytical characterization of the full posterior distribution for arbitrary priors, and analyze the asymptotic properties of this posterior distribution. We show that in a bivariate supply and demand example, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is negative, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any inference about the supply elasticity is coming solely from the prior distribution. More generally, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous coefficients in an n-variable VAR is confined to the set of values that orthogonalize the population variance-covariance matrix of OLS residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional to the height of the prior at any point within that set. We suggest that researchers should defend their prior beliefs explicitly and report the difference between prior and posterior distributions for key magnitudes of interest. We illustrate these methods with a simple macroeconomic model. 2},

abstract = {Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set of time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels — the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity smart meter data. The results show consistent performance gains compared to state-of-the art methods.},

abstract = {Abstract Density forecast combinations are becoming increasingly popular as a means of improving forecast 'accuracy', as measured by a scoring rule. In this paper we generalise this literature by letting the combination weights follow more general schemes. Sieve estimation is used to optimise the score of the generalised density combination where the combination weights depend on the variable one is trying to forecast. Specific attention is paid to the use of piecewise linear weight functions that let the weights vary by region of the density. We analyse these schemes theoretically, in Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical study. Our results show that the generalised combinations outperform their linear counterparts.},

@article{Wickramasuriya2015,
abstract = {Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical hierarchies. The forecasts for the disaggregated series are usually required to add up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint known as " aggregate consistency " . The combination forecasts proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) are based on a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimator and require an estimate of the covariance matrix of the reconciliation errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to aggregate inconsistency). We show that this is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. We propose a new combination forecasting approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of aggregate consistent forecasts. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error of the aggregate consistent forecasts across the en-tire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed form solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally less demanding alternative representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Temporal Hierarchies for time series forecasting. A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident {\&} Emergency departments.},

abstract = {In many applications, there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can be aggregated at several different levels in groups based on products, geography or some other features. We call these "hierarchical time series". They are commonly forecast using either a "bottom-up" or a "top-down" method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider a set of minimal identification conditions for dynamic factor models. These conditions have economic interpretations and require fewer number of restrictions than the static factor framework. Under these restric- tions, a standard structural vector autoregression (SVAR) with measurement errors can be embedded into a dynamic factor model. More generally, we also consider overidentification restrictions to achieve efficiency. General lin- ear restrictions, either in the form of known factor loadings or cross-equation restrictions, are considered. We further consider serially correlated idiosyn- cratic errors with heterogeneous coefficients. A numerically stable Bayesian algorithm for the dynamic factor model with general parameter restrictions is constructed for estimation and inference. A square-root form of Kalman filter is shown to improve robustness and accuracy when sampling the latent factors. Confidence intervals (bands) for the parameters of interest such as impulse responses are readily computed. Similar identification conditions are also exploited for multi-level factor models, and they allow us to study the “spill-over” effects of the shocks arising from one group to another. Key},
