\begin{abstract}
This paper contributes to the literature on optimal hierarchical forecast combination by introducing a Bayesian reconciliation framework. It allows for an explicit estimation of the reconciliation biases, which leads to several innovations: It is possible to use prior judgment to assign weights to specific forecasts, the occurence of negative reconciled forecasts can be ruled out and prediction intervals can be easily computed. The method is compared to existing reconciliation techniques using a comprehensive hierarchical dataset of Swiss goods exports, grouped by geographical and categorical characteristics.\\
