\begin{abstract}
This paper contributes to the literature on optimal hierarchical forecast combination by constructing a Bayesian reconciliation framework. Using partial regularization, it allows for the identification of the reconciliation errors as explicit parameters. This has several advantages: Probabilistic reconciliation takes the uncertainty surrounding these parameters into account and leads to reconciled density forecasts. Furthermore, flexible shrinkage priors enable the model to shrink selected reconciled forecasts towards their base forecast. The method is compared to existing reconciliation techniques using a comprehensive hierarchical dataset on exports of Swiss goods, grouped by geographical and categorical characteristics.\\
